This is my work for [TOP's Weather App Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app#solutions). This weather app is built off of the [open-meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) which conveniently require no API keys.

## Requirements
1. Provide weather forecast
    1. Write function that take a location and return its weather data by accessing an API
    2. Process the data from the API for use by the app
    3. Display the weather forecast, changing the look of the page to describe the current weather i.e. change the background image
2. Location search
    1. Form for users to enter their location
    2. Get weather forecast according to the user's input
3. Toggle between fahrenheit or celsius
4. (Optional) Show loading indicator while waiting for the weather data
